    "tinyjson is a library to parse/generate JSON format document. "
    " "
    "Goals of this library are "
    " "
    "Simplicity: This library uses standard containers like Vec or HashMap as "
    "its internal representation and exposes it to users. Users can operate "
    "JSON values via the standard APIs. And it keeps this crate as small as "
    "possible. "
    "Explicit: This library does not hide memory allocation from users. You "
    "need to allocate memory like Vec, String, HashMap by yourself. It is good "
    "for readers of your source code to show where memory allocations happen. "
    "And you can have control of how memory is allocated (e.g. allocating "
    "memory in advance with with_capacity method). "
    "No dependencies: This library is built on top of only standard libraries. "
    "No unsafe code: This library is built with Safe Rust. "
    "Well tested: This library is tested with famous test suites: "
    "JSON checker in json.org "
    "JSONTestSuite "
    "JSON-Schema-Test-Suite "
