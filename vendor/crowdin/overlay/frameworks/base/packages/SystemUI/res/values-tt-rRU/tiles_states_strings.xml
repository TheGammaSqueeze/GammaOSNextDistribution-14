<!-- This resources set the default subtitle for tiles. This way, each tile can be translated
     separately.
     The indices in the array correspond to the state values in QSTile:
      * STATE_UNAVAILABLE
      * STATE_INACTIVE
      * STATE_ACTIVE
     This subtitle is shown when the tile is in that particular state but does not set its own
     subtitle, so some of these may never appear on screen. They should still be translated as if
     they could appear.
